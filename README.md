# ml (Machine Learning)
This repository will follow and detail the programming assignments that I preform along with a Coursera online course for Machine Learning.

## lr (Logistic Regression)
The first assignment of the course, making using of Logistic Regression to classify admission based on two exam scores.
* Focuses on applying logistic regression with decision boundaries of various degrees and regularization
* ```lr.py``` - Basic 2-class linear regression
* ```rlr.py``` - Regularized linear regression (to prevent overfitting)
* ```mclr.py``` - Multi-class linear regression

## nn (Neural Networks)
Using logistic regression and neural networks to recongize handwritten digits.
